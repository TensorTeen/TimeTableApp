# TimeTableApp
It is an app to automate the inserting events to Google Calendar for IITM students. Creating a semester course calendar can be quite tedious and repetitive because of the predefined slots that each course can take. To remedy this, we have created a desktop tool using easygui and the icalendar libraries with Google Calendar API integration.

# Usage
Clone the repo and run the main.py file to launch the app.

Enter the start date and end date of the semster.

You can add courses as per your allotment by inputting the course name, description, location and then selecting the slot. The available slots can be modified in the slots.json file.

Once you added all courses, you can export it as either a ical file or to your Google Calendar(TODO).
